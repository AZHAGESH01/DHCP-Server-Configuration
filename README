Cisco DHCP Configuration Workflow (WRT300N + Router + Clients)

📘 Overview
This README explains how to configure and verify DHCP across multiple interfaces in your Packet Tracer lab, including router configuration, DHCP pools, and checking client connections (like DVRs, PCs, or Wi-Fi devices).


🧩 1. Router Interface Configuration

FastEthernet0/0 (LAN 1)
```bash
interface FastEthernet0/0
 ip address 172.16.150.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
```

FastEthernet0/1 (LAN 2)
```bash
interface FastEthernet0/1
 ip address 172.16.160.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
```


⚙️ 2. DHCP Configuration

Exclude Gateway Addresses
```bash
ip dhcp excluded-address 172.16.150.1 172.16.150.10
ip dhcp excluded-address 172.16.160.1 172.16.160.10
```

Create DHCP Pools
For LAN 1 (Fa0/0)
```bash
ip dhcp pool LAN_IT
 network 172.16.150.0 255.255.255.0
 default-router 172.16.150.1
 dns-server 8.8.8.8
 lease 1
```

For LAN 2 (Fa0/1)
```bash
ip dhcp pool LAN_SALES
 network 172.16.160.0 255.255.255.0
 default-router 172.16.160.1
 dns-server 8.8.8.8
 lease 1
```

🧰 3. Verification Commands

Check Interfaces
```bash
show ip interface brief
```
Confirms which ports are UP and assigned IPs.

Check DHCP Leases
```bash
show ip dhcp binding
```
Lists all IPs assigned by DHCP to clients.

Check DHCP Conflicts
```bash
show ip dhcp conflict
clear ip dhcp conflict *
```

🧠 4. WRT300N Verification (Client Side)

Access Router Web Interface
1. Open browser → http://192.168.1.1
2. Login: admin / admin
3. Go to **Status → Local Network → DHCP Clients Table**
4. View all connected devices and their IPs.

Wireless Devices
Navigate to **Status → Wireless → Wireless Clients Table**

---

🧪 5. Client Testing

On PCs or DVRs
```cmd
ipconfig /release
ipconfig /renew
```
- Should receive IP in `172.16.150.x` or `172.16.160.x`
- Gateway should be `.1` of respective subnet

Ping Test
```cmd
ping 172.16.150.1
ping 172.16.160.1
```

---

🧾 6. Optional Commands

Restart DHCP service:
```bash
no service dhcp
service dhcp
```

View logs for DHCP assignment events:
```bash
debug ip dhcp server events
```

---

📜 Notes
- Use **Packet Tracer 8.x or later** for full DHCP compatibility.
- If using older IOS (like 12.x), some `clear ip dhcp binding` commands may not work — use `no ip dhcp pool` + recreate method.
- Always **save configuration** after changes:
```bash
write memory
```

✅ Expected Result
| Interface | Network | DHCP Range | Status |
|------------|----------|-------------|----------|
| Fa0/0 | 172.16.150.0/24 | 172.16.150.11–254 | UP |
| Fa0/1 | 172.16.160.0/24 | 172.16.160.11–254 | UP |

Clients connected to Fa0/0 get `172.16.150.x`  
Clients connected to Fa0/1 get `172.16.160.x`
